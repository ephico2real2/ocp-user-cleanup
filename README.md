# OpenShift User & Identity Cleanup Tool

A **safe, modular, cross-platform bash utility** for managing and cleaning up OpenShift users and identities associated with an LDAP provider.

## ðŸ›  Makefile Options

This project includes a Makefile to simplify common operations. Using the Makefile provides consistent command execution with predefined options and ensures proper file paths.

### Common Makefile Targets

| Target | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `make scan` | Find users and create CSV report (no deletions) |
| `make process` | Delete users from existing CSV report |
| `make dry-run` | Preview deletions (creates CSV if missing) |
| `make full` | Scan and delete in one step |
| `make test-gen` | Generate test users for testing |
| `make test-clean` | Remove test users |
| `make clean` | Remove generated CSV and log files |
| `make help` | Show available commands and options |

### Usage Examples

**Scan for users without making changes:**
```bash
make scan
```

**Perform a dry run to preview changes:**
```bash
make dry-run
```

**Process users from an existing scan:**
```bash
make process
```

**Generate test users for testing:**
```bash
make test-gen TEST_COUNT=50 TEST_PREFIX=qa-user
```

**Remove test users:**
```bash
make test-clean
```

### Customizable Variables

You can override default variables:

```bash
# Custom CSV location
make scan CSV_FILE=./custom/path/users.csv

# Custom exclude file
make process EXCLUDE_FILE=./custom/path/excluded_users.txt

# Generate specific number of test users
make test-gen TEST_COUNT=100

# Custom test user prefix
make test-gen TEST_PREFIX=qa-user
```

Supports:
- LDAP provider-based user and identity cleanup
- Bulk scanning and deletion of OpenShift identities and users
- Exclusion of specific users from deletion (via file)
- Dry-run mode for safe verification
- Auto-confirmation support for non-interactive usage
- Debug and quiet operation modes
- Configurable retry mechanisms for improved reliability
- Cross-platform compatibility (Linux & macOS, Bash 3.2+)

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ clean-ocp-users.sh    # Main cleanup script
â”œâ”€â”€ config/

## âœ… Usage Scenarios

### Basic Cleanup with Default Provider

```bash
./scripts/clean-ocp-users.sh
```

### Dry Run Mode (simulate deletions)

```bash
./scripts/clean-ocp-users.sh --dry-run
```

### Specify Custom LDAP Provider

```bash
./scripts/clean-ocp-users.sh --provider custom_ldap_prefix
```

### Use Exclusion File

```bash
./scripts/clean-ocp-users.sh --exclude-file ./config/excluded_users.txt
```

### Non-Interactive Mode (auto-confirm)

```bash
./scripts/clean-ocp-users.sh --yes
```

### Custom CSV and Log Locations

```bash
./scripts/clean-ocp-users.sh --csv ./custom/path/users.csv --log ./custom/path/cleanup.log
```

## ðŸ›¡ Safety Features

* Dry-run mode to preview changes (`--dry-run`)
* Confirmation prompt before deletions (unless `--yes` specified)
* Optional exclusion file support (`--exclude-file`)
* Detailed logging of all operations
* Configurable retry mechanisms for reliability
* CSV report generation for audit purposes
* Debug mode for detailed operation tracking
---

## ðŸ“„ Exclusion File Example (`excluded_users.txt`)

```
abc31323
cde72928
juk78000
```

Location:
```
./config/excluded_users.txt
```

---

## ðŸ’» Platform Compatibility

### System Requirements

* Bash 3.2+ (macOS default bash supported)
* OpenShift CLI (`oc`)
* `jq` (JSON processor)

### Tested Platforms

* âœ… Linux (Ubuntu, RHEL, etc.)
* âœ… macOS (Intel & ARM)
  * Works with default Bash 3.2
  * Optional: Install newer Bash via Homebrew:
    ```bash
    brew install bash
    ```
