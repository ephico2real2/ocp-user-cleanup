# OpenShift User & Identity Cleanup Tool

A **safe, modular, cross-platform bash utility** for managing and cleaning up OpenShift users and identities associated with an LDAP provider.

Supports:
- LDAP provider-based user and identity cleanup
- Bulk scanning and deletion of OpenShift identities and users
- Exclusion of specific users from deletion (via file)
- Dry-run mode for safe verification
- Auto-confirmation support for non-interactive usage
- Debug and quiet operation modes
- Configurable retry mechanisms for improved reliability
- Cross-platform compatibility (Linux & macOS, Bash 3.2+)

```bash
./scripts/clean-ocp-users.sh --dry-run
```

### Specify Custom LDAP Provider

```bash
./scripts/clean-ocp-users.sh --provider custom_ldap_prefix
```

### Use Exclusion File

```bash
./scripts/clean-ocp-users.sh --exclude-file ./config/excluded_users.txt
```

### Non-Interactive Mode (auto-confirm)

```bash
./scripts/clean-ocp-users.sh --yes
```

### Custom CSV and Log Locations

```bash
./scripts/clean-ocp-users.sh --csv ./custom/path/users.csv --log ./custom/path/cleanup.log
```

* Confirmation prompt before deletions (unless `--yes` specified)
* Optional exclusion file support (`--exclude-file`)
* Detailed logging of all operations
* Configurable retry mechanisms for reliability
* CSV report generation for audit purposes
* Debug mode for detailed operation tracking
